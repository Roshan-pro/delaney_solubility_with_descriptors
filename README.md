## Introduction
This project focuses on predicting the solubility (logS value) of molecular formulas using various descriptors. The dataset used is based on the Delaney solubility dataset, and the models are built using different machine learning techniques.

## Features
- Data Preprocessing: Includes cleaning and preparing the dataset.
- Feature Engineering: Various molecular descriptors are calculated.
- Model Training: Multiple machine learning models are trained and evaluated.
- Prediction: Predicts the logS value for new molecular formulas.

## Installation
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Roshan-pro/delaney_solubility_with_descriptors.git
   cd delaney_solubility_with_descriptors
2.Create a virtual environment and activate it:
  '''sh 
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
